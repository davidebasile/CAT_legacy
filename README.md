This is the legacy code of earlier CAT version and has been replaced. 
Not all functionalities have been maintained in the new version.
Check the new repository version.

The directory JaMaTa contains the java tool, see JaMaTa/README.

The folder ampl contains a tool implemented in AMPL for deciding if a CA is weakly safe and admits weak agreement,
see README inside ampl.

Developed with JDK 7 and Eclipse.
A file Readme is located in the workspace with some useful comments.
